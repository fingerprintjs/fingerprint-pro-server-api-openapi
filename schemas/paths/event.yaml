  operationId: 'updateEvent'
  summary: Update an event
  description: |
    Change information in existing events specified by `event_id` or *flag suspicious events*.
    
    When an event is created, it can be assigned `linked_id` and `tags` submitted through the JS agent parameters. 
    This information might not have been available on the client initially, so the Server API permits updating these attributes after the fact.
    
    **Warning** It's not possible to update events older than one month. 
    
    **Warning** Trying to update an event immediately after creation may temporarily result in an 
    error (HTTP 409 Conflict. The event is not mutable yet.) as the event is fully propagated across our systems. In such a case, simply retry the request.
