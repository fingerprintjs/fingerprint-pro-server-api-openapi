    ## Search

    The `/v4/events` endpoint provides a convenient way to search for past events based on specific parameters. Typical use cases and queries include:

    - Searching for events associated with a single `visitor_id` within a time range to get historical behavior of a visitor.
    - Searching for events associated with a single `linked_id` within a time range to get all events associated with your internal account identifier.
    - Excluding all bot traffic from the query (`good` and `bad` bots)

    If you don't provide `start` or `end` parameters, the default search range is the **last 7 days**.

    ### Filtering events with the `suspect` flag

    The `/v4/events` endpoint unlocks a powerful method for fraud protection analytics. The `suspect` flag is exposed in all events where it was previously set by the update API.

    You can also apply the `suspect` query parameter as a filter to find all potentially fraudulent activity that you previously marked as `suspect`. This helps identify patterns of fraudulent behavior.
    
    ### Environment scoping

    If you use a secret key that is scoped to an environment, you will only get events associated with the same environment. With a workspace-scoped environment, you will get events from all environments.

    Smart Signals not activated for your workspace or are not included in the response.
  parameters:
    - name: limit
      in: query
      required: false
      schema:
        type: integer
        format: int32

    - name: pagination_key
      in: query
      schema:
        type: string
      description: |
        Use `pagination_key` to get the next page of results.

        When more results are available (e.g., you requested up to 100 results for your query using `limit`, but there are more than 100 events total matching your request), the `pagination_key` field is added to the response. The pagination key is an arbitrary string that should not be interpreted in any way and should be passed as-is. In the following request, use that value in the `pagination_key` parameter to get the next page of results:

        1. First request, returning most recent 200 events: `GET api-base-url/events?limit=100`
        2. Use `response.pagination_key` to get the next page of results: `GET api-base-url/events?limit=100&pagination_key=1740815825085`
