        Filter visits by `requestId`. 
        
        Every identification request has a unique identifier associated with it called `requestId`. This identifier is returned to the client in the identification [result](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/js-agent#requestid). When you filter visits by `requestId`, only one visit will be returned.

      description: |
        Filter visits by your custom identifier. 
        
        You can use [`linkedId`](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/js-agent#linkedid) to associate identification requests with your own identifier, for example: session ID, purchase ID, or transaction ID. You can then use this `linked_id` parameter to retrieve all events associated with your custom identifier.

      description: |
        Limit scanned results. 
        
        For performance reasons, the API first scans some number of events before filtering them. Use `limit` to specify how many events are scanned before they are filtered by `requestId` or `linkedId`. Results are always returned sorted by the timestamp (most recent first).
        By default, the most recent 100 visits are scanned, the maximum is 500.

      description: |
        Use `paginationKey` to get the next page of results. 
        
        When more results are available (e.g., you requested 200 results using `limit` parameter, but a total of 600 results are available), the `paginationKey` top-level attribute is added to the response. The key corresponds to the `requestId` of the last returned event. In the following request, use that value in the `paginationKey` parameter to get the next page of results:
        
        1. First request, returning most recent 200 events: `GET api-base-url/visitors/:visitorId?limit=200`
        2. Use `response.paginationKey` to get the next page of results: `GET api-base-url/visitors/:visitorId?limit=200&paginationKey=1683900801733.Ogvu1j`
        
        Pagination happens during scanning and before filtering, so you can get less visits than the `limit` you specified with more available on the next page. When there are no more results available for scanning, the `paginationKey` attribute is not returned.

  tags:

  operationId: 'deleteVisitorData'
  summary: Delete data by visitor ID
  description: |
    Request deleting all data associated with the specified visitor ID. This API is useful for compliance with privacy regulations.
    ### Which data is deleted?
    - Browser (or device) properties
    - Identification requests made from this browser (or device)

    #### Browser (or device) properties
    - Represents the data that Fingerprint collected from this specific browser (or device) and everything inferred and derived from it.
    - Upon request to delete, this data is deleted asynchronously (typically within a few minutes) and it will no longer be used to identify this browser (or device) for your [Fingerprint Application](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/glossary#fingerprint-application).

    #### Identification requests made from this browser (or device)
    - Fingerprint stores the identification requests made from a browser (or device) for up to 30 (or 90) days depending on your plan. To learn more, see [Data Retention](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/regions#data-retention).
    - Upon request to delete, the identification requests that were made by this browser
      - Within the past 10 days are deleted within 24 hrs.
      - Outside of 10 days are allowed to purge as per your data retention period.

    ### Corollary
    After requesting to delete a visitor ID,
    - If the same browser (or device) requests to identify, it will receive a different visitor ID.
    - If you request [`/events` API](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/getevent) with a `request_id` that was made outside of the 10 days, you will still receive a valid response.
    - If you request [`/visitors` API](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/getvisits) for the deleted visitor ID, the response will include identification requests that were made outside of those 10 days.

    ### Interested?
    Please [contact our support team](https://fingerprint.com/support/) to enable it for you. Otherwise, you will receive a 403.
