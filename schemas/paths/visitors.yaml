  summary: Delete data by visitor ID
  description: |
    Request deleting all data associated with the specified visitor ID. This API is useful for compliance with privacy regulations.

    ### Which data is deleted?
    - Browser (or device) properties
    - Identification requests made from this browser (or device)

    #### Browser (or device) properties
    - Represents the data that Fingerprint collected from this specific browser (or device) and everything inferred and derived from it.
    - Upon request to delete, this data is deleted asynchronously (typically within a few minutes) and it will no longer be used to identify this browser (or device) for your [Fingerprint Workspace](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/glossary#fingerprint-workspace).

    #### Identification requests made from this browser (or device)
    - Fingerprint stores the identification requests made from a browser (or device) for up to 30 (or 90) days depending on your plan. To learn more, see [Data Retention](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/regions#data-retention).
    - Upon request to delete, the identification requests that were made by this browser
      - Within the past 10 days are deleted within 24 hrs.
      - Outside of 10 days are allowed to purge as per your data retention period.

    ### Corollary
    After requesting to delete a visitor ID,
    - If the same browser (or device) requests to identify, it will receive a different visitor ID.
    - If you request [`/v4/events` API](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/getevent) with an `event_id` that was made outside of the 10 days, you will still receive a valid response.

    ### Interested?
    Please [contact our support team](https://fingerprint.com/support/) to enable it for you. Otherwise, you will receive a 403.
