  Sums key data points for a specific `visitorId`, `ipAddress` and `linkedId` at three distinct time
  intervals: 5 minutes, 1 hour, and 24 hours as follows: 

  - Number of identification events associated with the visitor ID. 
  - Number of distinct linked IDs associated with the visitor ID.
  - Number of distinct IP addresses associated to the visitor ID.
  - Number of distinct countries associated with the visitor ID.
  - Number of events associated for the detected IP address.
  - Number of distinct IP addresses associated with the provided linked ID.
  - Number of distinct visitor IDs associated with the provided linked ID.

  The `24h` interval of `distinctIp`, `distinctLinkedId`, and `distinctCountry`
  will be omitted if the number of `events` for the visitor ID in the last 24
  hours (`events.intervals.['24h']`) is higher than 20.000.
