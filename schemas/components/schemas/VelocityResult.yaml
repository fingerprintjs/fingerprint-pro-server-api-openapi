description: >
  Sums key data points for a specific `visitorId`, `ipAddress` and `linkedId` at three distinct time
  intervals: 5 minutes, 1 hour, and 24 hours as follows: 

  - Number of identification events attributed to the visitor ID - Number of
  distinct IP addresses associated to the visitor ID. - Number of distinct
  countries associated with the visitor ID. - Number of distinct `linkedId`s
  associated with the visitor ID.
  - Number of events recorded for the detected IpAddress
  - Number of Distinct Ip addresses associated and Number of distinct visitors
    for the provided LinkedId 

  The `24h` interval of `distinctIp`, `distinctLinkedId`, and `distinctCountry`
  will be omitted if the number of `events` for the visitor ID in the last 24
  hours (`events.intervals.['24h']`) is higher than 20.000.
