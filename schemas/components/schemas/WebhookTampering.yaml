      Flag indicating browser tampering was detected. This happens when either of these conditions is true:
        * There are inconsistencies in the browser configuration that cross our internal tampering thresholds (indicated by `anomalyScore`).
        * The browser signature resembles one of "anti-detect" browsers specifically designed to evade identification and fingerprinting, for example, Incognition (indicated by `antiDetectBrowser`).
  anomalyScore:
    type: number
    format: double
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 1

      Confidence score (`0.0 - 1.0`) for tampering detection:
        * Values above `0.5` indicate that there was a tampering attempt
        * Values below `0.5` indicate genuine browsers.
  antiDetectBrowser:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      Is `true` if the identified browser resembles one of "anti-detect" browsers, for example, Incognition. Anti-detect browsers try to evade identification by masking or manipulating their fingerprint to imitate legitimate browser configurations.
