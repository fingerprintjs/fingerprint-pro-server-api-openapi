    type: boolean

      * `true` - The request contains anomalous data that could only have been generated through manual intervention, i.e. data that could not have been legitimately produced by Fingerprint's JS agent or Android SDK. 
      * `false` - The request is considered genuine or was generated by the iOS SDK.

      `result` is `true` when either the `anomalyScore` is above `0.5` or `antiDetectBrowser` is `true`.
  anomalyScore:
    type: number
    format: double
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 1
    description: |
      A score that indicates the extent of anomalous data in the request.
        * Values above `0.5` indicate that the request has been tampered with.
        * Values below `0.5` indicate that the request is genuine.
  antiDetectBrowser:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Anti-detect browsers try to evade identification by masking or manipulating their fingerprint to imitate legitimate browser configurations. This field does not apply to requests originating from mobile SDKs.
      * `true` - The browser resembles a known anti-detect browser, for example, Incognition.
      * `false` - The browser does not resemble an anti-detect browser or the request originates from a mobile SDK.
