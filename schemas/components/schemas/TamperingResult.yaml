      true if tampering is identified based on an anomalyScore or antiDetectBrowser signal by comparing their browser signature to our statistical model and checking whether the visitor is using an anti-detect browser such as Incogniton.
    example: false
  anomalyScore:
    type: number
    description: >-
      Confidence score (`0.0 - 1.0`) for the tampering detection. Values above
      `0.5` suggest that we're reasonably sure there was a tampering attempt.
      Values below `0.5` are genuine browsers.
    example: 0
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 1
  antiDetectBrowser:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      Is `true` if the identified browser is one of "anti-detect" browsers specifically designed to evade identification and fingerprinting. Anti-detect browsers are specialized browsers designed to mask or manipulate the user's fingerprint by mimicking legitimate browser configuration
