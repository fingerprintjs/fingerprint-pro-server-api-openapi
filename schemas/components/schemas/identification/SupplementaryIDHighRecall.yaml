  A supplementary browser identifier that prioritizes coverage over precision. The High Recall ID algorithm matches more generously, i.e., this identifier will remain the same even when there are subtle differences between two requests. This algorithm does not create as many new visitor IDs as the standard algorithms do, but there could be an increase in false-positive identification.
required:
  - visitor_id
  - visitor_found
properties:
  visitor_id:
    type: string
    description: String of 20 characters that uniquely identifies the visitor's browser or mobile device.
  visitor_found:
    type: boolean
    description: Attribute represents if a visitor had been identified before.
