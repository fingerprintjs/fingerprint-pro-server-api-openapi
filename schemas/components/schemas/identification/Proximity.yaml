    description: |
      A value between `0` and `1` representing the likelihood that the true device location lies within the mapped proximity zone.
        * Scores closer to `1` indicate high confidence that the location is inside the mapped proximity zone.
        * Scores closer to `0` indicate lower confidence, suggesting the true location may fall in an adjacent zone.
