properties:
  timezoneMismatch:
    type: boolean
    description: The browser timezone doesn't match the timezone inferred from the request IP address.
  publicVPN:
    type: boolean
    description: Request IP address is owned and used by a public VPN service provider.
  auxiliaryMobile:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      This method applies to mobile devices only. Indicates the result of additional methods used to detect a VPN in mobile devices.
  osMismatch:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      The browser runs on a different operating system than the operating system inferred from the request network signature.
  relay:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Request IP address belongs to a relay service provider, indicating the use of relay services like [Apple Private relay](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102602) or [Cloudflare Warp](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/). 
      
      * Like VPNs, relay services anonymize the visitor's true IP address.
      * Unlike traditional VPNs, relay services don't let visitors spoof their location by choosing an exit node in a different country.
      
      This field allows you to differentiate VPN users and relay service users in your fraud prevention logic.
