  Sums key data points for a specific `visitor_id`, `ip_address` and `linked_id` at three distinct time
  intervals: 5 minutes, 1 hour, and 24 hours as follows: 

  - Number of distinct IP addresses associated to the visitor Id.
  - Number of distinct linked Ids associated with the visitor Id.
  - Number of distinct countries associated with the visitor Id.
  - Number of identification events associated with the visitor Id.
  - Number of identification events associated with the detected IP address.
  - Number of distinct IP addresses associated with the provided linked Id.
  - Number of distinct visitor Ids associated with the provided linked Id.

  The `24h` interval of `distinct_ip`, `distinct_linked_id`, `distinct_country`,
  `distinct_ip_by_linked_id` and `distinct_visitor_id_by_linked_id` will be omitted 
  if the number of `events` for the visitor Id in the last 24
  hours (`events.['24h']`) is higher than 20.000.

  All will not necessarily be returned in a response, some may be omitted if the 
  associated event does not have the required data, such as a linked_id.
