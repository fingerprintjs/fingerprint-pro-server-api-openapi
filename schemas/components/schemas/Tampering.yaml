      Indicates if an identification request from a browser or an Android SDK has been tampered with. Not supported in the iOS SDK, is always `false` for iOS requests.
        * `true` - If the request meets either of the following conditions:
          * Contains anomalous browser or device attributes that could not have been legitimately produced by the JavaScript agent or the Android SDK (see `anomalyScore`).
          * Originated from an anti-detect browser like Incognition (see `antiDetectBrowser`).
        * `false` - If the request is considered genuine or was generated by the iOS SDK.
  anomalyScore:
    type: number
    format: double
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 1
    description: |
      A score that indicates the extent of anomalous data in the request. This field applies to requests originating from **both** browsers and Android SDKs. 
        * Values above `0.5` indicate that the request has been tampered with.
        * Values below `0.5` indicate that the request is genuine.
  antiDetectBrowser:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Anti-detect browsers try to evade identification by masking or manipulating their fingerprint to imitate legitimate browser configurations. This field does not apply to requests originating from mobile SDKs.
        * `true` - The browser resembles a known anti-detect browser, for example, Incognition.
        * `false` - The browser does not resemble an anti-detect browser or the request originates from a mobile SDK.
